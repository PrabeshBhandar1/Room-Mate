RoomMate is a web-based rental platform designed for Nepal to simplify how tenants find rooms or full flats and how owners list their properties. Built using Next.js and Supabase, the system provides secure authentication for tenants, owners, and admins, along with a clean and efficient workflow for property listing and approval.

Owners can create listings with essential details such as price, location, water availability, parking options, allowed tenants, and room/flat type. They can upload photos, edit listings, and manage their posts. Every new listing requires manual admin approval before it becomes publicly visible.

Tenants can search approved listings by area and sort results by price. Each listing includes photos, detailed room information, and an option to message the owner through a simple, text-only real-time chat.

Admins moderate the entire platform by reviewing and approving listings, ensuring quality and preventing misuse.

RoomMate focuses on providing a fast, secure, and user-friendly rental experience tailored for Nepali users, without unnecessary features—keeping the system clean, reliable, and easy to use.
